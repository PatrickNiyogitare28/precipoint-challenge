The techinical challenge

## JSON server

You need to first run the JSON server by

`yarn api` or `npm run api`
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Used Tool

- Ngrx for global bread crumb state management
- Rxjs for reactive programing and service subscription
- Scss for styleing
